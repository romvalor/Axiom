## Version History

### v2.34 — xclog Console Capture Tool (2026-03-15)

**xclog — iOS console capture for LLMs.** No single external tool replicates Xcode's debug console. xclog combines `simctl launch --console` (print/debugPrint) with `log stream --style ndjson` (os_log/Logger) into unified structured JSON output, purpose-built for LLM consumption.

**Tool** (`tools/xclog/`):
- `launch` — full capture (print + os_log), simulator only
- `attach` — live os_log stream from running process, simulator only
- `show` — historical log search (post-mortem), works with simulator AND physical devices via `log collect`
- `list` — discover installed apps on simulator
- JSON-lines output by default with level, subsystem, category, process, pid fields
- `--timeout`, `--max-lines` for bounded capture (context-safe for LLMs)
- `--filter` (regex), `--subsystem` for noise reduction
- Universal binary (ARM64 + Intel) shipped at `bin/xclog`
- 30 unit tests, fuzz-tested ndjson parser (1.8M executions, 0 failures)

**Axiom integration**:
- `axiom-xclog-ref` reference skill — TDD-tested (13/13 RED→GREEN), crash diagnosis and silent failure workflows
- `/axiom:console` command — guided capture with list → launch flow
- Session-start hook injects xclog awareness into every conversation
- Routed via `ios-build` (entry #16) and `ios-performance` routers
- VitePress doc pages for skill and command
- MCP bundle updated (searchable via MCP server)

**TDD results**: RED phase identified 13 failure modes without the skill (partial capture, unbounded output, no JSON, no bundle ID discovery, context flooding, app state loss, misdiagnosis risk). GREEN phase confirmed all 13 addressed. One REFACTOR applied (launch-vs-attach decision promoted to Critical Best Practices).

### LLDB Debugging Skill Suite (2026-02-18)

**New LLDB debugging skills** — Complete LLDB debugging support with discipline + reference skill pair:
- `axiom-lldb` (discipline) — 6 playbooks for crash triage, state inspection, `po` alternatives, breakpoint strategy, expression evaluation, and thread analysis. Includes LLDB-vs-other-tools decision tree and anti-rationalization for print-statement debugging
- `axiom-lldb-ref` (reference) — Complete LLDB command reference organized by task: variable inspection (`v`/`p`/`po` with flags), breakpoints (conditional, symbolic, exception, regex), thread navigation, expression evaluation, memory commands, and `.lldbinit` customization

Routed via `axiom-ios-performance` router.

### v2.20 — MCP Server + Games/3D Skills (2026-02-05)

**Axiom MCP server** — Axiom now includes an [MCP (Model Context Protocol) server](https://charleswiltgen.github.io/Axiom/guide/mcp-install) that brings its iOS development skills to any MCP-compatible AI coding tool — VS Code with GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Gemini CLI, and more. The server includes MCP tool annotations (read-only hints, titles) and server-level instructions so MCP clients can discover Axiom's capabilities automatically. Supports BM25 with fuzzy matching and prefix search.

**New 3D and games skill suites**:
- `axiom-spritekit` (discipline) – 2D game architecture, scene graphs, physics, actions, game loops
- `axiom-spritekit-ref` (reference) – Complete SpriteKit API guide with SwiftUI integration
- `axiom-spritekit-diag` (diagnostic) – Troubleshooting rendering, physics, and performance
- `axiom-realitykit` (discipline) – ECS architecture, entity-component patterns, RealityView
- `axiom-realitykit-ref` (reference) – Comprehensive RealityKit API and AR patterns
- `axiom-realitykit-diag` (diagnostic) – Troubleshooting entity loading, physics, and rendering
- `axiom-scenekit` (discipline) – 3D scene graphs, materials, animations, SceneKit migration
- `axiom-scenekit-ref` (reference) – Complete SceneKit API guide
- New `spritekit-auditor` agent automatically scans SpriteKit code for common issues

**Other improvements**:
- Updated `ios-games` and `ios-graphics` routers cover SpriteKit, SceneKit, RealityKit, and display performance

### v2.19 — Agent Skills Standard + Xcode Context (2026-02-03)

**Agent Skills standard compliance** — Axiom is now compatible with the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) open standard, a portable format for giving AI agents new capabilities. Originally developed by Anthropic, it's now supported by Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, VS Code, GitHub Copilot, OpenAI Codex, Roo Code, and many others. This means Axiom's iOS development expertise is no longer locked to a single tool. As Agent Skills support rolls out across these products, the same skills you use in Claude Code today will work in whichever AI coding tool you pick up tomorrow.

**Apple documentation access** — Axiom now reads Apple's official for-LLM documentation directly from your local Xcode installation, giving Axiom access to authoritative Apple guidance as well as Axiom's deep superset of agents and skills. Docs are read from your local Xcode install at runtime, so this support is always current.

**Other improvements**:
- New `axiom-swiftui-search-ref` (reference) skill covers foundational SwiftUI search APIs
- Aligned 4 skills with 18 newly documented APIs from WWDC 2025-323 (Build a SwiftUI app with the new design)
- Corrected 10+ API names validated against WWDC transcripts and Apple documentation
- Migrated 129 skill files to Agent Skills spec with `license: MIT` and standardized metadata

### v2.19.4 — Apple Documentation Integration (2026-02-03)
Integrated Apple's Xcode-bundled for-LLM documentation as a content source in the MCP server and Claude Code plugin.

- **20 Apple guides** — Liquid Glass (SwiftUI/UIKit/AppKit/WidgetKit), Foundation Models, Swift 6.2 concurrency, SwiftData class inheritance, Swift Charts 3D, App Intents, StoreKit, and more
- **32 Swift compiler diagnostics** — Actor isolation, Sendable, data races, type system, ownership — with official explanations and code fixes
- **Runtime reading** — Docs read from local Xcode installation, stay current when Xcode updates
- **MCP server integration** — Unified `Skill` interface with `source` tracking ('axiom' | 'apple'), BM25 search with source filter, `[Apple]` tags in catalog
- **New router skill** — `axiom-apple-docs` routes questions to specific Apple doc files
- **Graceful degradation** — Works without Xcode; disable with `AXIOM_APPLE_DOCS=false`
- **Config** — `AXIOM_XCODE_PATH` for custom Xcode path, `AXIOM_APPLE_DOCS` enable/disable

**Files**: `xcode-docs.ts` (Xcode detection + loading), `parser.ts` (`SkillSource`, `parseAppleDoc()`), `dev-loader.ts`/`prod-loader.ts` (Apple docs overlay), `search/index.ts` (source filter), `catalog/index.ts` (Apple doc categories), `tools/handler.ts` (source tags), `config.ts` (env vars), `axiom-apple-docs/SKILL.md` (router), `session-start.sh` (Xcode detection at startup)

### v2.18.1 — Claude Code 2.1.19-2.1.22 Compatibility (2025-01-28)
Verified compatibility with Claude Code 2.1.19-2.1.22. Key findings:

- **All 68 skills are hook-free** — Auto-approve in 2.1.19+ (zero friction for users)
- **Agent skills injection works correctly** — 30 agents properly inject router skills
- **Background agent permissions** — 2.1.20 prompts upfront (UX improvement, not breaking)
- **No breaking changes** — Commands, skills, and agents work unchanged

Audit tasks completed:
1. Skills hook audit — confirmed all skills hook-free
2. Command argument syntax — $0/$1 shorthand not needed (agent-launcher pattern)
3. Agent permissions — read-only agents need no prompts, Bash agents prompt upfront
4. Task deletion feature — not applicable (agents use "scan and report" pattern)

### Agent Skills Injection (2025-01-10)
Added `skills` field to all 26 agents, injecting appropriate router skills into each agent's context. **Critical fix**: Sub-agents do NOT automatically inherit skills from the main conversation — the `skills` field is required to give agents access to Axiom's specialized knowledge.

**Mappings**: Each agent now receives its domain-specific router skill:
- Build/environment agents → `axiom-ios-build`
- UI/SwiftUI agents → `axiom-ios-ui`
- Data/persistence agents → `axiom-ios-data`
- Concurrency agents → `axiom-ios-concurrency`
- Performance agents → `axiom-ios-performance`
- Testing agents → `axiom-ios-testing`
- Networking agents → `axiom-ios-networking`
- Integration agents → `axiom-ios-integration`
- Accessibility agents → `axiom-ios-accessibility`

**Files modified**: All 26 agent files in `.claude-plugin/plugins/axiom/agents/`

**Discovery**: Found via Claude Code 2.1.2/2.1.3 changelog research — official docs confirm sub-agents need explicit `skills` field injection.

### v2.0.0 — Two-Layer Routing Architecture (2025-12-20)
**Major architectural redesign** implementing progressive disclosure pattern inspired by Superpowers 4. Solves the core problem: skills almost never triggered voluntarily. **Root causes addressed**: (1) No discipline injection - SessionStart hook now injects `using-axiom` skill via `additionalContext`, (2) Keyword-based descriptions allowed rationalization - changed to anti-rationalization imperatives ("Use when ANY..."), (3) Too many manifest items (92) overwhelmed system prompt - reduced to 10 routers.

**Architecture**: Two-layer routing with progressive disclosure:
- **Layer 1 (Manifest)**: 10 router skills with broad, anti-rationalization descriptions (ios-build, ios-ui, ios-data, ios-concurrency, ios-performance, ios-networking, ios-integration, ios-accessibility, ios-ai, ios-vision)
- **Layer 2 (Invoked)**: 74 specialized skills invoked by routers based on user request
- **Hook**: SessionStart injects using-axiom discipline skill establishing "check skills BEFORE ANY RESPONSE"
- **Backward compatible**: All 74 specialized skills, 19 agents, 21 commands work unchanged

**Metrics**: Character budget reduced 85% (13,242 → 1,985 chars, 13,015 headroom). Manifest items reduced 89% (92 → 10 routers). Router descriptions average 199 chars with rich anti-rationalization language. **84 total skills** (10 routers + 74 specialized including using-axiom).

**Implementation**: Created session-start.sh hook with `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` injection, 10 router skills with decision trees and routing logic, updated claude-code.json to routers-only manifest, updated `.claude/rules/skill-descriptions.md` with router philosophy. Testing documentation in `notes/router-architecture-testing.md`.

**Expected behavior**: Skills trigger proactively via discipline injection + anti-rationalization descriptions, eliminating need for explicit user prompts. Maintains "84 skills" marketing accuracy through intelligent routing. Based on Jesse Vincent's Superpowers 4 pattern and character budget research.

### v1.5.0 — Vision Framework Skills Suite (2025-12-20)
Comprehensive Vision framework skill suite covering people-focused computer vision: **vision** discipline skill (600 lines), **vision-ref** reference skill (900 lines), **vision-diag** diagnostic skill (550 lines). Based on WWDC 2023/10176 "Lift subjects from images in your app", WWDC 2023/111241 "3D body pose and person segmentation", and WWDC 2020/10653 "Detect Body and Hand Pose". **Coverage**: Subject segmentation (VNGenerateForegroundInstanceMaskRequest, VisionKit), hand pose detection (21 landmarks), body pose detection (2D/3D), person segmentation (up to 4 people), face detection, CoreImage integration for HDR compositing. **Key pattern**: Isolating objects while excluding hands (user's original use case) - combines subject mask + hand pose detection + custom masking. **Platform support**: iOS 14+ (hand/body pose), iOS 16+ (VisionKit), iOS 17+ (instance masks, 3D pose). **Token budget**: 14,286 chars total (714 headroom), vision skills: 519 chars combined. Documentation added to `docs/skills/computer-vision/` and `docs/reference/` with new Computer Vision category. **73 total skills** (vision, vision-ref, vision-diag added).

### Manifest Optimization (2025-12-18) — Token Budget Compliance
Rewrote all 86 skill/agent descriptions to comply with Claude Code's 15,000 character system prompt budget. Changed from verbose sentence format to concise comma-separated keyword lists. **Results**: Reduced from 28,499 → 13,242 chars (54% reduction, 1,758 char headroom). Skills averaged 146 chars (down from 324), agents 185 chars (down from 359). Maintained trigger effectiveness by preserving error messages, technical keywords, user symptoms, and framework names. Added `.claude/rules/skill-descriptions.md` with format guidelines and validation scripts. **Impact**: Ensures all skills remain discoverable in Claude Code's system prompt instead of being silently invisible beyond the budget limit. Based on Jesse Vincent's blog post discovering the 15k constraint.

### Skill Update (2025-12-16) — Localization v1.1.0
Updated **localization** reference skill with Xcode 26 type-safe localization patterns from WWDC 2025-225 "Explore localization with Xcode". Added Part 10 covering: generated symbols (compile-time error checking), automatic comment generation (on-device AI), `#bundle` macro (official Swift Package solution), custom table symbol access, two localization workflows (string extraction vs generated symbols), and refactoring tools. Updated System Requirements for Xcode 26+. Primary source: WWDC 2025-225. Supplementary: Daniel Saidi blog post on public wrapper patterns for advanced cross-package scenarios. Skill v1.0.0 → v1.1.0 (260+ lines added). Documentation updated in both skill file and VitePress docs.

### v1.0.3 — Documentation & Command Alignment
Updated documentation to fully align with plugin manifest commands. Added missing documentation pages for 7 commands: `/axiom:ask`, `/axiom:audit`, `/axiom:status`, `/axiom:fix-build`, `/axiom:optimize-build`, `/axiom:audit-swiftui-nav`, and `/axiom:audit-swiftui-performance`. Updated `/commands` index page to include all 18 commands with working links and added missing `audit-textkit` entry.

### v1.0.0 — SwiftUI Architecture Skill (TDD Tested - Grade A+)
Comprehensive SwiftUI architecture skill covering Apple patterns, MVVM, TCA, and Coordinator approaches for iOS 26+. **swiftui-architecture** discipline skill (1,070 lines, Grade A+, full RED-GREEN-REFACTOR testing). Based on WWDC 2025/266, 2024/10150, 2023/10149. Covers State-as-Bridge pattern, @Observable models, property wrapper decision trees (3 questions), MVVM for complex presentation logic, TCA trade-offs analysis, Coordinator patterns for navigation, 4-step refactoring workflow, 5 anti-patterns with before/after code, 3 pressure scenarios, and code review checklist. **TDD Results**: Prevents "refactor later" rationalization under deadline pressure (Scenario 1 flip from FAIL to PASS), resists 9 pressure types (deadline, authority, sunk cost, existential threat, hybrid approaches, pattern purity), prevents both under-extraction AND over-extraction (balanced guidance). Test artifacts in `scratch/swiftui-architecture-test-results.md`. Documentation page at `docs/skills/ui-design/swiftui-architecture.md`. **First v1.0 release - production-ready comprehensive architecture guidance.**

Commands are explicit shortcuts that launch agents, complementing natural language triggering. Zero duplication: all logic lives in agents, commands are ~20-line bookmarks. **8 commands + 8 agents for maximum discoverability and UX flexibility.**

### v0.9.16 — SwiftUI Performance Agent
Added **swiftui-performance-analyzer** that automatically scans for performance anti-patterns: expensive operations in view bodies (formatters, I/O, image processing), whole-collection dependencies, missing lazy loading, frequently changing environment values, and missing view identity. Detects the 8 most common SwiftUI performance issues. **8 total agents.**

### v0.9.15 — Agents-Only Architecture
Completed migration from commands to agents. Added **core-data-auditor** (schema migration risks, thread-confinement violations, N+1 queries), **liquid-glass-auditor** (iOS 26 adoption opportunities, toolbar improvements, blur effect migrations), **networking-auditor** (deprecated APIs like SCNetworkReachability, anti-patterns, App Store rejection risks). Removed all 6 audit commands in favor of natural language triggering. **7 total agents now cover all audit needs proactively.**

### v0.9.14 — Quick Win Agents
Three new autonomous agents that proactively scan for common issues: **accessibility-auditor** (VoiceOver labels, Dynamic Type, color contrast, WCAG compliance), **concurrency-validator** (Swift 6 strict concurrency violations, unsafe Task captures, missing @MainActor), **memory-audit-runner** (6 common leak patterns: timers, observers, closures, delegates, view callbacks, PhotoKit). All use haiku model for fast execution.

### v0.9.13 — Autonomous Agents
build-fixer agent automatically diagnoses and fixes Xcode build failures (zombie processes, Derived Data, simulator issues, SPM cache) using environment-first diagnostics. Saves 30+ minutes by running diagnostics and applying fixes autonomously. **First autonomous agent for Axiom!**
