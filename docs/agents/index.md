# Autonomous Agents

Axiom includes 18 autonomous agents that automatically detect and diagnose common iOS development issues.

## What Are Agents?

Agents are autonomous problem-solvers that:
- **Trigger automatically** based on keywords in your conversation
- **Run independently** with their own model and tools
- **Scan your codebase** for specific anti-patterns
- **Provide actionable fixes** with file:line references and code examples

## How to Use Agents

**Natural language (recommended)** — Just describe what you want:

- "Check my code for accessibility issues" → **accessibility-auditor** triggers
- "Scan for memory leaks" → **memory-auditor** triggers
- "My SwiftUI app has janky scrolling" → **swiftui-performance-analyzer** triggers
- "Review for Swift 6 concurrency violations" → **concurrency-auditor** triggers
- "Check Core Data safety" → **core-data-auditor** triggers
- "Find Liquid Glass adoption opportunities" → **liquid-glass-auditor** triggers
- "Scan for deprecated networking APIs" → **networking-auditor** triggers
- "Review my in-app purchase implementation" → **iap-auditor** triggers
- "Implement in-app purchases" → **iap-implementation** triggers
- "My build is failing" → **build-fixer** triggers
- "My builds are slow" → **build-optimizer** triggers
- "Run a health check on my project" → **health-check** triggers
- "Scan everything for issues" → **health-check** triggers
- "Check my navigation architecture" → **swiftui-nav-auditor** triggers
- "Validate my App Store screenshots" → **screenshot-validator** triggers
- "Take a screenshot to verify this fix" → **simulator-tester** triggers

**Explicit commands** — For direct invocation:

```bash
/axiom:audit-accessibility
/axiom:audit-memory
/axiom:audit-swiftui-performance
/axiom:audit-concurrency
/axiom:audit-core-data
/axiom:audit-iap
/axiom:audit-liquid-glass
/axiom:audit-networking
/axiom:audit-swiftui-nav
/axiom:audit-icloud
/axiom:audit-storage
/axiom:fix-build
/axiom:optimize-build
/axiom:audit screenshots
/axiom:test-simulator
/axiom:health-check
```

## Agent Categories

### UI & Design
- **liquid-glass-auditor** — Identifies iOS 26+ Liquid Glass adoption opportunities (glass effects, toolbar improvements, search patterns, migration from old blur effects)
- **swiftui-architecture-auditor** — Scans SwiftUI architecture (logic in view bodies, async boundary violations, property wrapper misuse, testability gaps)
- **swiftui-layout-auditor** — Scans SwiftUI layout code for GeometryReader misuse, deprecated screen APIs, hardcoded breakpoints, identity loss, missing lazy containers
- **swiftui-performance-analyzer** — Detects SwiftUI performance anti-patterns (expensive operations in view bodies, missing lazy loading, unnecessary updates, navigation performance issues)
- **swiftui-nav-auditor** — Scans SwiftUI navigation architecture (missing NavigationPath, deep link gaps, state restoration issues, wrong container usage, type safety problems)

### Persistence & Storage
- **core-data-auditor** — Scans for schema migration risks, thread-confinement violations, N+1 query patterns, production data loss risks, performance issues
- **database-schema-auditor** — Scans database migration and schema code for unsafe ALTER TABLE patterns, DROP operations, missing idempotency, foreign key misuse
- **icloud-auditor** — Scans for iCloud integration issues (missing NSFileCoordinator, unsafe CloudKit error handling, missing entitlement checks, SwiftData + CloudKit anti-patterns)
- **storage-auditor** — Detects file storage mistakes (files in wrong locations, missing backup exclusions, missing file protection, storage anti-patterns causing data loss and backup bloat)
- **swiftdata-auditor** — Scans SwiftData code for struct models, missing VersionedSchema, relationship defaults, background context misuse, N+1 patterns

### Integration
- **camera-auditor** — Scans for camera, video, and audio capture issues including deprecated APIs, missing interruption handlers, threading violations
- **foundation-models-auditor** — Scans Foundation Models code for missing availability checks, main thread blocking, manual JSON parsing, session lifecycle issues
- **networking-auditor** — Scans for deprecated networking APIs (SCNetworkReachability, CFSocket, NSStream) and anti-patterns (reachability checks, hardcoded IPs, missing error handling)
- **iap-auditor** — Audits existing IAP code for missing transaction.finish() calls, weak receipt validation, missing restore functionality, subscription status tracking issues, and StoreKit testing configuration gaps
- **iap-implementation** — Implements complete StoreKit 2 IAP solution with testing-first workflow (.storekit configuration, centralized StoreManager, transaction handling, subscription management, restore purchases)

### Shipping
- **screenshot-validator** — AI-powered visual inspection of App Store screenshots for dimension validation, placeholder text detection, debug artifact scanning, competitor references, and content completeness
- **security-privacy-scanner** — Scans for API keys in code, insecure @AppStorage usage, missing Privacy Manifests, ATS violations, and logging sensitive data

### Testing
- **performance-profiler** — Automated performance profiling via xctrace CLI (CPU Profiler, Allocations, Leaks, SwiftUI, Swift Tasks)
- **simulator-tester** — Automated simulator testing with visual verification (screenshots, video, location simulation, push notifications, permissions, deep links, log analysis) for closed-loop debugging
- **test-debugger** — Closed-loop test debugging: analyzes failures, suggests fixes, re-runs tests until passing

- **testing-auditor** — Scans for flaky test patterns, shared mutable state, missing assertions, Swift Testing migration opportunities

### Misc
- **crash-analyzer** — Parses crash reports (.ips, .crash), checks symbolication, categorizes by crash pattern, generates actionable diagnostics
- **modernization-helper** — Scans for legacy patterns and provides migration paths to iOS 17/18 (ObservableObject to @Observable, etc.)

## Why Agents?

**Before** (Commands):
- User must remember `/axiom:audit-accessibility`
- Manual invocation every time
- Duplication between command and skill implementations

**After** (Agents):
- Natural language: "check accessibility"
- Automatic triggering based on context
- One source of truth, zero duplication
- Scales better (9 agents = 9 files + 9 commands = 18 total, not 18 duplicated implementations)

## Agent Architecture

All agents:
- Use **haiku model** for fast execution (<1 second scans)
- Provide **file:line references** for easy fixing
- Include **severity ratings** (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Show **before/after code examples**
- Recommend **testing strategies** to verify fixes
