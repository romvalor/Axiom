# Commands

Quick automated scans to identify issues in your codebase. Type `/command-name` in Claude Code to run.

## Start Here

**Not sure which command to use?** Start with `/axiom:ask`:

```bash
/axiom:ask "My build is failing"
/axiom:ask "How do I optimize SwiftUI performance?"
/axiom:ask "Check my code for memory leaks"
```

This routes your question to the right Axiom skill or agent automatically.

## Usage

```bash
# Utility commands
/axiom:ask "My build is failing"
/axiom:audit                    # Smart mode - analyze and suggest audits
/axiom:health-check             # Run all relevant auditors in parallel
/axiom:status                   # Check health

# Audit commands (unified syntax)
/axiom:audit accessibility      # VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, WCAG

/axiom:audit swiftui-performance # Expensive body, missing lazy
/axiom:audit swiftui-architecture # Logic in view, testability
/axiom:audit swiftui-nav        # Navigation architecture
/axiom:audit swift-performance  # ARC issues, allocation
/axiom:audit core-data          # Thread safety, migrations
/axiom:audit networking         # Deprecated APIs
/axiom:audit codable            # JSON serialization

/axiom:audit storage            # File storage safety
/axiom:audit liquid-glass       # iOS 26 adoption
/axiom:audit textkit            # TextKit modernization

# Build commands
/axiom:fix-build                # Diagnose and fix build failures
/axiom:optimize-build           # Optimize build performance

# Testing commands
/axiom:screenshot               # Quick screenshot
/axiom:test-simulator           # Full simulator testing
```
