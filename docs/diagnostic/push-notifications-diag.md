# Push Notifications Diagnostics

Systematic push notification troubleshooting for delivery failures, token issues, sandbox/production mismatch, silent push throttling, and rich notification problems.

## Symptoms This Diagnoses

Use when you're experiencing:
- Notifications not arriving at all
- Push works in development but not production
- `didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError` fires
- Silent push not waking the app
- Rich notification shows plain text (missing media)
- Live Activity not updating via push
- Notifications stopped after iOS update
- FCM works on Android but not iOS
- Badge count not clearing or updating
- Notification actions not appearing

## Example Prompts

Questions you can ask Claude that will invoke this diagnostic:

- "Why aren't my push notifications arriving?"
- "Push works in the simulator but not on device"
- "My notifications work in dev but not production"
- "Silent push notifications aren't waking my app"
- "Rich notification images aren't showing"
- "Live Activity push updates aren't working"
- "FCM push works on Android but not iOS"
- "How do I debug APNs delivery?"

## Diagnostic Workflow

The diagnostic follows a systematic approach:

1. **Token registration** — Verify entitlements, provisioning profile, APNs environment
2. **Server-side delivery** — Check APNs response codes, token validity, certificate/JWT expiry
3. **Device-side reception** — Confirm foreground/background delegate handling, notification settings
4. **Payload validation** — Verify aps dictionary structure, content-available for silent push, size limits
5. **Extension debugging** — Service extension not called, attachment download failures, 30s timeout
6. **Environment mismatch** — Sandbox vs production tokens, certificate type, APNs endpoint
