## Skills

- **[Swift Concurrency](/skills/concurrency/swift-concurrency)** – Swift 6 strict concurrency patterns, async/await, MainActor, Sendable, and actor isolation
  - *"I'm getting 'Main actor-isolated property accessed from nonisolated context' errors everywhere."*
  - *"My code is throwing 'Type does not conform to Sendable' warnings when passing data between threads."*
  - *"I have a stored task causing memory leaks. How do I write it correctly with weak self?"*

- **[Swift Concurrency Reference](/reference/swift-concurrency-ref)** – API reference for actors, Sendable, Task/TaskGroup, AsyncStream, continuations, migration patterns
  - *"How do I create a TaskGroup?"*
  - *"What's the AsyncStream continuation API?"*
  - *"How do I convert completion handlers to async?"*

- **[Swift Performance](/skills/concurrency/swift-performance)** – Optimizing Swift code performance: ARC overhead, unspecialized generics, collection inefficiencies, actor isolation costs
  - *"My Swift code is allocating too much memory"*
  - *"How do I reduce ARC overhead in hot loops?"*

- **[Modern Swift Idioms](/skills/concurrency/swift-modern)** – Corrects outdated Swift patterns: legacy APIs, pre-5.5 syntax, Foundation modernization, Claude hallucination fixes
  - *"Review my Swift code for outdated patterns"*
  - *"Why am I using DateFormatter when I could use FormatStyle?"*

- **[assumeIsolated](/skills/concurrency/assume-isolated)** – Synchronous actor access for tests, legacy callbacks, and performance-critical code
  - *"How do I access MainActor state from a delegate callback that runs on main thread?"*
  - *"What's the difference between Task { @MainActor in } and MainActor.assumeIsolated?"*

- **[Synchronization](/skills/concurrency/synchronization)** – Thread-safe primitives: Mutex (iOS 18+), OSAllocatedUnfairLock, Atomic types
  - *"Should I use Mutex or actor for this hot path?"*
  - *"What's the difference between os_unfair_lock and OSAllocatedUnfairLock?"*

- **[Ownership Conventions](/skills/concurrency/ownership-conventions)** – borrowing/consuming modifiers for performance and noncopyable types
  - *"What does borrowing do in Swift?"*
  - *"How do I use ~Copyable types?"*

- **[Combine Patterns](/skills/concurrency/combine-patterns)** – Combine reactive programming: publisher lifecycle, operators, @Published traps, async/await bridging
  - *"Should I use Combine or async/await for this?"*
  - *"My Combine pipeline silently stops producing values"*

- **[Concurrency Profiling](/skills/concurrency/concurrency-profiling)** – Instruments workflows for async/await performance
  - *"My async code is slow, how do I profile it?"*
  - *"I think I have actor contention, how do I diagnose it?"*
