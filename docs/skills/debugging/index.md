- **[Memory Debugging](/skills/debugging/memory-debugging)** – Systematic leak diagnosis with 5 patterns covering 90% of real-world issues
  - *"My app crashes after 10-15 minutes of use with no error messages. How do I find the leak?"*
  - *"View controllers don't deallocate after dismiss. How do I find the retain cycle?"*
  - **Command** [`/axiom:audit-memory`](/commands/debugging/audit-memory) for quick triage scanning
